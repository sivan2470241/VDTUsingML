With the rapid growth of surveillance cameras to monitor the human activity demands such
system which recognize the violence and suspicious events automatically. Abnormal and violence action
detection has become an active research area of computer vision and image processing to attract new
researchers. The relevant literature presents different techniques for detection of such activities from the
video proposed in the recent years. This paper reviews various state-of-the-art techniques of violence detec-
tion. In this paper, the methods of detection are divided into three categories that is based on classification
techniques used: violence detection using traditional machine learning, using support vector machine (SVM),
and using deep learning. The feature extraction techniques and object detection techniques of the each
single method are also presented. Moreover, datasets and video features that used in the techniques, which
play a vital role in recognition process are also discussed. For better understanding, the steps of the
research approaches have been presented in an architecture diagram. The overall research findings have
been discussed which may be helpful for finding the potential future work in this research domain.
